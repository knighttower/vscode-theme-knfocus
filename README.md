# KnFocus README

-   Two themes to balance the contrast between the editor and the rest of the UI.
-   Minimizes the amount of colors used to better focus on the code.
-   Uses the similar colors for both themes to make switching between them easier.
-   Uses colors that are easy on the eyes to avoid eye strain.

**Enjoy!**
